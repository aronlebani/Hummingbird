# Hummingbird
A light and zippy bookmarks navigator.

## Description
Hummingbird is a chrome extension that helps you navigate your bookmarks faster.
It works with your existing bookmark manager, which means you can still create and edit bookmarks in the usual way.

## Features
* Opens when you create a new tab
* Search through all your bookmarks
* Hotkeys for quicker navigation
* Ignore feature - decide which bookmarks to exclude in Hummingbird

## Other Notes
Hummingbird is designed to be as simple as possible and only supports a single level of folder hierarchy. It will display a flattened version of your bookmark folders, but won't touch the structure of your actual bookmarks.

Hummingbird doesn't create, delete, or manage your bookmarks, it simply allows you to navigate them quickly and easily. Managing your bookmarks can be done with Chrome's built in bookmark manager (or a third party bookmark manager).
